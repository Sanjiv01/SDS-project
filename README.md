## Exploratory Data Analysis

Describe your dataset. Explain the meaning of the columns that is there in the dataset.  
Data Cleaning – Handle the missing data for both categorical and numerical variables (by dropping and imputing).
(Note: The missing values cannot be just ignored or deleted without examining)
Remove unwanted observations – Duplicate/irrelevant/repetitive.
Fix the typos and inconsistent capitalization.

## Graph Visualization

Visualize the dataset to exhibit meaningful insights from it.
Use any three graph visualization techniques.
Filter unwanted outliers.
Numerical – Box plot / Histogram.
Categorical – Bar chart.

## Normalization and Standardization

Compute the mean and variance for each of the columns.
Normalize all the numeric columns, to make mean 0 and variance 1
Discuss why is normalization is needed? How does it affect dataset?
Use graphs used to check whether the data is normal.

## Hypothesis Testing

State the research hypothesis.
Perform statistical tests.
Freedom to make your own hypothesis based on the columns.
Decide whether the null hypothesis is supported or rejected.

## Correlation

Find the correlation between variables that are positively and negatively related.
State inferences about it.
